### *MILITARY LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN*  

*OVERVIEW:* 
Need for Military Logistics and Supply Chain
Military logistics and supply chain management are vital components of defense operations, playing a key role in ensuring mission success. The complexity and scale of modern military operations demand a robust and efficient logistics system. Below are the core reasons for its importance:

1. Operational Readiness:
Ensures troops, equipment, and supplies are available when and where needed.
Reduces downtime and enhances mission effectiveness.

2. Strategic Advantage:
Provides a competitive edge by enabling rapid deployment and resupply.
Supports sustained operations in hostile or remote environments.

3. Resource Optimization:
Ensures efficient use of limited resources, including manpower, fuel, and equipment.
Minimizes waste and ensures sustainability.

4. Disaster and Crisis Response:
Supports humanitarian missions and disaster relief operations.
Enables quick mobilization of resources during emergencies.

5. Adapting to Challenges:
Handles disruptions caused by geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, or supply chain vulnerabilities.
Prepares for contingencies with flexible and scalable solutions.

*Technical Stack:*  
Languages: C++
Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

*Impact:* 
Impact of Military Logistics and Supply Chain
